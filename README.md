# 1. Timeseries data:  

### Create a distributed CrateDB cluster in the Cloud. Explore a time series data set containing weather information from Chicago.

- *The story begins with Time Series Data - the heartbeat of the digital universe. From stock prices to weather patterns, from IoT sensor readings to user interactions, time series data is everywhere.*
- *But here's the challenge: How do we make sense of this vast, continuously evolving data? How do we turn it into foresight rather than just hindsight?*

# 2. Full Text and Vector Search:  

### Dive into CrateDB's full-text and vector search capabilities, and understand the basics of hybrid search.

# 3. Multi Model Data:  

### Discover the multi-model capabilities of CrateDB and learn how these can be used to contextualize data.*  

- *We'll take a dataset and show you how to apply full-text and vector similarity searches to it.*
- *We'll learn how these two approaches differ, and we'll introduce how they can be combined in a hybrid search scenario.*
