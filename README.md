1. timeseries_data:  
  Create a distributed CrateDB cluster in the Cloud. Explore a time series data set containing weather information from Chicago.  
    The story begins with Time Series Data - the heartbeat of the digital universe. From stock prices to weather patterns, from IoT sensor readings to user interactions, time series data is everywhere.  
    But here's the challenge: How do we make sens of this vast, continuosly evolving data? How do we turn it into foresight rather than just hindsight?  

3. full_text_and_vector_search:  
  Dive in to CrateDB's full-text and vector search capabilities, and understand the basics of hybrid search.  

4. multi_model_data:  
    Discover the multi-model capabilities of CrateDB and learn these can be used to contextualize data.  
    We'll take a dataset and show you how to apply full-text and vector similarity searchs to it. We'll learn how these two approaches differ, and we'll introduce how they can be combine in a hybrid search scenario.
